Rock-Paper-Scissors project on TOP finished.
At first I've created the game only using javaScript, and everything including result 
playerChoice, computerChoice, explanation, was only printed to the console.

At the second part, after finishing DOM Manipulations and Events lesson on TOP, I've created
index and style files, added content and designed the website. Now you can play the game by clicking
buttons and all infos are shown also on the page.

The most important part of the project was to practice DOM Manipualtions, Event Listeners and also the whole 
second part was developed in a separate branch rps-ui, and merged to the main branch.
